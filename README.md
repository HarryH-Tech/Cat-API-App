<h1>Cat Search</h1>

This project was built with create-react-app. To run the app simply clone the repo and run ```npm install``` in the directory and then ```npm run start```.

It was built as a short take home project for a company  with instructions to retrieve data from an [REST API](https://thecatapi.com/) and render it to the page using any framework/language I wanted. I chose React because its the one I enjoy using the most and the one I have the most experience in.
